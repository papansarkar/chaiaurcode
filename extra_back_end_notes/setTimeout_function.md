The `setTimeout()` function in JavaScript is a built-in function that allows you to execute a piece of code after a specified delay. It is commonly used for timing-related tasks, such as scheduling code to run after a certain period.

## `setTimeout()` Explained:
Definition: setTimeout() is a Web API function provided by the browser or Node.js environment that allows you to defer the execution of a callback function after a given number of milliseconds.

Syntax:

```javascript
setTimeout(function, delay, [arguments]);
```

### function: 
The function to be executed after the delay.
### delay: 
The time in milliseconds after which the function should be executed.
### [arguments]: 
Optional parameters to pass to the function when it's executed.
Example

```javascript
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Executed after 2 seconds");
}, 2000);
```
In the example above, the arrow function will be executed after a delay of 2000 milliseconds (or 2 seconds).

## Assigning `setTimeout()` to a Variable

If you assign `setTimeout()` to a variable, what you are actually assigning is a **timeout ID**, not the callback function itself. This ID can be used later to cancel the timeout using `clearTimeout()`.

```javascript
const timerId = setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("This will run after 2 seconds");
}, 2000);

console.log(timerId); // Logs the timeout ID
```


## Why the Function Gets Called Automatically
If you store the function directly in a variable without wrapping it in another function or using a function reference, it will execute immediately.

Consider the following code:

```javascript
const timer = setTimeout(console.log("Hello!"), 2000);
```

In this example, `console.log("Hello!")` is called immediately, before setTimeout() runs. The result of `console.log("Hello!")` (which is undefined) is passed to `setTimeout()`, and thus, undefined is not the desired behavior.

## To solve this issue, you should pass a reference to the function, not call the function directly:

```javascript
const timer = setTimeout(() => console.log("Hello!"), 2000);
```
Here, `() => console.log("Hello!")` is an arrow function that is passed as a callback to `setTimeout()`. It wonâ€™t execute immediately but will instead be deferred by `setTimeout()`.

## Summary
`setTimeout()` is a built-in function that schedules code to run after a specified delay.
When assigning `setTimeout()` to a variable, it stores a timeout ID, not the function itself.
If you want to defer a function call, pass the function reference or use an arrow function instead of invoking it directly. This way, the function will not run immediately.
